Camera movement prompts:

1. Slow dolly zoom: A gradual push-in or pull-back while simultaneously zooming the lens in the opposite direction, creating a disorienting effect that emphasizes the subject while subtly warping the background perspective.

2. Steadicam tracking shot: Smooth, gliding movement that follows a character or object through space, maintaining consistent framing while the environment flows around the subject, creating an immersive, three-dimensional feel.

3. Crane shot: Vertical movement that ascends or descends smoothly, revealing scale and context as the camera rises above or descends below the action, often used for dramatic reveals or establishing shots.

4. Pan and tilt: Horizontal rotation (pan) or vertical rotation (tilt) of the camera on a fixed axis, used to follow action, reveal information, or create a sense of scanning across a scene.

5. Dutch angle: Tilted camera position that creates a sense of unease, tension, or dynamic energy, with the horizon line appearing at an angle rather than horizontal.

6. Handheld movement: Slight, natural camera shake that creates intimacy and realism, as if the viewer is present in the scene, often used for documentary-style or intense emotional moments.

7. Slow push-in: Gradual forward movement toward the subject, building tension and focus, often used to emphasize a character's emotional state or important visual details.

8. Pull-back reveal: Moving the camera backward to reveal more of the environment or context, often used for dramatic reveals or to show the relationship between characters and their surroundings.

9. Circular tracking: Camera moves around the subject in a circular or arc-like motion, creating a sense of three-dimensionality and allowing multiple perspectives of the same moment.

10. Whip pan: Rapid horizontal movement that creates a blur effect, often used for quick transitions between scenes or to convey urgency and energy.
