  ```
  Begin with a close-up shot of the protagonist's face, capturing every subtle expression of determination.
  ```

- **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**: Frames a conversation or interaction from behind a character, adding context and immersion.

  ```
  Transition to an over-the-shoulder shot of the mentor observing the apprentice's work.
  ```

- **High Angle Shot**: Positions the camera above the subject, often making them appear vulnerable or smaller.

  ```
  Use a high angle shot to reveal the hero standing alone in a vast, empty field, emphasizing their isolation.
  ```

- **Low Angle Shot**: Positions the camera below the subject, making them appear more imposing or powerful.

  ```
  From a low angle shot, show the towering figure of the CEO addressing the crowd.
  ```

- **Bird's Eye View**: Looks straight down, offering an omniscient perspective.

  ```
  Begin with a bird's eye view shot of the city streets, bustling with midday activity.
  ```

- **Dutch Angle**: Tilts the camera to create tension or unease.

  ```
  Cut to a Dutch angle shot of the alleyway, conveying a sense of disorientation and danger.
  ```

- **Wide Shot (WS)**: Captures a large area, providing context and setting.

  ```
  Start with a wide shot of the bustling marketplace, showcasing the vibrant stalls and busy shoppers.
  ```

- **Medium Shot (MS)**: Frames the subject from the waist up, balancing detail and context.

  ```
  Use a medium shot to show the protagonist engaging in a heated conversation with the antagonist.
  ```

---

## 6. Enhancing Narratives with Camera Movements

Camera movements add dynamism, guiding the viewer's focus and setting the tone.

### Examples:

- **Pan (Horizontal Pivot)**: Sweeps across a scene, revealing more information.

  ```
  Pan across the skyline, slowly revealing the hidden rooftop garden.
  ```

- **Tilt (Vertical Pivot)**: Moves the frame up or down, showcasing height or dropping focus.

  ```
  Tilt downward from the treetops to the forest floor, unveiling a hidden cabin.
  ```

- **Dolly (In/Out)**: Moves the camera closer or farther away from the subject, adding depth.

  ```
  Dolly in toward the antique music box, focusing on its intricate details as it begins to play.
  ```

- **Truck (Left/Right)**: Moves the camera laterally, maintaining distance from the subject.

  ```
  Truck left alongside the running character, keeping pace with their movement through the crowded street.
  ```

- **Crane (Jib)**: Moves the camera vertically, often transitioning between ground and aerial perspectives.

  ```
  Crane up from the street level to reveal the full scale of the skyscraper, ending in an aerial view.
  ```

- **Zoom**: Changes the focal length to bring the subject closer or push it away.

  ```
  Zoom in slowly on the detective's eyes as they discover a crucial clue.
  ```

- **Steadicam**: Provides smooth, fluid movement, often following a subject.

  ```
  Use a Steadicam to follow the protagonist as they navigate through the maze-like corridors.
  ```

- **Arc**: Moves the camera in a curved path around the subject.

  ```
  Arc around the statue, revealing its details from multiple angles in a single continuous movement.
  ```

- **Roll**: Rotates the camera around its axis, creating a disorienting effect.

  ```
  Roll the camera slightly to create a sense of unease as the character realizes they're being watched.
  ```

- **Whip Pan**: A rapid pan that creates a blur transition between scenes.

  ```
  Whip pan from the hero to the villain, creating a dynamic transition between perspectives.
  ```

- **Handheld**: Creates a shaky, documentary-style feel, adding realism or tension.

  ```
  Use handheld camera work to capture the chaotic energy of the protest march.
  ```
