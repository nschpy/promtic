## Basic Movements

### 1. Pan and Tilt

```text
Horizontal rotation (pan) or vertical rotation (tilt) of the camera on a fixed axis, used to follow action, reveal information, or create a sense of scanning across a scene.
```

### 2. Handheld Movement

```text
Slight, natural camera shake that creates intimacy and realism, as if the viewer is present in the scene, often used for documentary-style or intense emotional moments.
```

### 3. Dutch Angle

```text
Tilted camera position that creates a sense of unease, tension, or dynamic energy, with the horizon line appearing at an angle rather than horizontal.
```

### 4. Locked-off Shot

```text
Static camera position that remains completely still, emphasizing the action within the frame and creating a sense of stability, observation, or formal composition.
```

---

## Tracking & Following

### 5. Steadicam Tracking Shot

```text
Smooth, gliding movement that follows a character or object through space, maintaining consistent framing while the environment flows around the subject, creating an immersive, three-dimensional feel.
```

### 6. Trucking Shot

```text
Lateral movement where the camera moves left or right parallel to the subject, maintaining consistent distance while revealing the environment horizontally, often used to follow walking characters or explore a space.
```

### 7. Circular Tracking

```text
Camera moves around the subject in a circular or arc-like motion, creating a sense of three-dimensionality and allowing multiple perspectives of the same moment.
```

### 8. Arc Shot

```text
Camera moves in a curved path around the subject, maintaining focus on the central element while the background shifts, creating a dynamic sense of movement and spatial awareness.
```

### 9. Leading Shot

```text
Camera moves ahead of a subject, pulling them forward through space and creating anticipation as the viewer sees what lies ahead before the character arrives.
```

### 10. Following Shot

```text
Camera trails behind a subject, moving in their wake and creating a sense of pursuit, observation, or journey as the environment unfolds before both camera and character.
```

### 11. Low Angle Tracking

```text
Camera moves forward or laterally while positioned low to the ground, creating a sense of power, dominance, or urgency as it moves beneath or alongside subjects.
```

### 12. High Angle Tracking

```text
Camera moves while positioned above the action, looking down as it travels, providing an omniscient perspective that can follow movement while maintaining a sense of overview.
```

### 13. Diagonal Tracking

```text
Camera moves diagonally through space, combining forward and lateral movement to create dynamic, multi-directional motion that feels more complex and engaging.
```

### 14. Lateral Dolly

```text
Smooth horizontal movement perpendicular to the action, creating a sense of parallel motion that maintains consistent framing while the environment flows past.
```

### 15. Parallax Movement

```text
Camera moves while maintaining focus on a foreground subject, causing background elements to shift at different speeds, creating depth and a sense of three-dimensional space.
```

## Zoom & Focus Techniques

### 16. Slow Zoom

```text
Gradual, deliberate zoom that draws attention to specific details or emotional moments, building focus and intensity over time without physical camera movement.
```

### 17. Crash Zoom

```text
Sudden, rapid zoom into a subject that creates an intense, jarring effect, emphasizing a moment of shock, realization, or dramatic impact.
```

### 18. Slow Dolly Zoom

```text
A gradual push-in or pull-back while simultaneously zooming the lens in the opposite direction, creating a disorienting effect that emphasizes the subject while subtly warping the background perspective.
```

### 19. Vertigo Effect

```text
Extreme dolly zoom combined with camera movement, creating an intense disorienting effect where the background appears to stretch or compress dramatically while the subject remains constant.
```

### 20. Rack Focus

```text
Shifting focus from one subject to another within the same frame, guiding the viewer's attention and creating depth by emphasizing different layers of the composition.
```

## Aerial & Elevated Shots

### 21. Crane Shot

```text
Vertical movement that ascends or descends smoothly, revealing scale and context as the camera rises above or descends below the action, often used for dramatic reveals or establishing shots.
```

### 22. Drone Shot

```text
Aerial movement that glides smoothly through three-dimensional space, offering sweeping views and dynamic perspectives that can ascend, descend, or orbit around subjects from above.
```

### 23. Helicopter Shot

```text
Wide, sweeping aerial movement that covers large distances, providing epic scale and dramatic overviews of landscapes, action sequences, or large-scale events.
```

### 24. Overhead Shot

```text
Camera positioned directly above the action, looking down vertically, providing a bird's-eye view that reveals spatial relationships, patterns, and the full scope of a scene.
```

### 25. Jib Shot

```text
Vertical and horizontal movement combined using a jib arm, allowing the camera to rise, fall, and pivot smoothly, creating elegant transitions between different heights and angles.
```

---

## Reveals & Transitions

### 26. Pull-back Reveal

```text
Moving the camera backward to reveal more of the environment or context, often used for dramatic reveals or to show the relationship between characters and their surroundings.
```

### 27. Slow Push-in

```text
Gradual forward movement toward the subject, building tension and focus, often used to emphasize a character's emotional state or important visual details.
```

### 28. Tilt-up Reveal

```text
Camera tilts upward from a low position, gradually revealing a subject or environment from bottom to top, building anticipation and emphasizing vertical scale.
```

### 29. Tilt-down Reveal

```text
Camera tilts downward from a high position, slowly uncovering elements below and creating a sense of discovery or dramatic revelation.
```

### 30. Reverse Pull-back

```text
Camera moves backward while maintaining focus on a receding subject, creating a sense of separation, conclusion, or emotional distance as the scene expands around them.
```

### 31. Whip Pan

```text
Rapid horizontal movement that creates a blur effect, often used for quick transitions between scenes or to convey urgency and energy.
```

---

## Specialized Techniques

### 32. SnorriCam

```text
Camera mounted directly on the subject, moving with them to create an intimate, disorienting perspective that makes the background appear to flow around a static central figure.
```

### 33. Gimbal Movement

```text
Ultra-smooth, stabilized motion that combines multiple axes of movement, creating fluid, floating camera work that feels weightless and cinematic.
```

### 34. Slider Shot

```text
Precise horizontal or vertical movement along a track, creating smooth, controlled motion that emphasizes subtle shifts in perspective or reveals elements within the frame.
```

### 35. 360-degree Rotation

```text
Camera circles completely around a subject or scene, providing a full panoramic view that reveals all angles and creates a sense of complete spatial understanding.
```

### 36. Orbital Rotation

```text
Camera circles around a subject while maintaining consistent distance and angle, creating a mesmerizing, hypnotic effect that emphasizes the central element from all sides.
```

### 37. Push-pull Combination

```text
Alternating between forward and backward movement, creating a rhythmic, breathing-like motion that emphasizes the relationship between subject and environment.
```

### 38. Forward Rush

```text
Rapid forward movement that accelerates toward a subject, creating urgency, momentum, and a sense of being pulled into the action or moment.
```

### 39. Undulating Movement

```text
Smooth, wave-like motion that rises and falls rhythmically, creating a flowing, organic feel that mimics natural movement patterns.
```

### 40. Time-lapse Movement

```text
Camera moves slowly over an extended period, capturing gradual changes in light, weather, or activity, creating a compressed sense of time passing.
```

## Usage Tips

- **Combine movements**: Many techniques work well together (e.g., crane + pan, dolly + zoom)
- **Match emotion**: Choose movements that enhance the emotional tone of your scene
- **Consider pacing**: Fast movements create energy; slow movements build tension
- **Think in 3D**: Camera movement adds depth and dimension to flat compositions
- **Practice restraint**: Sometimes a static shot is more powerful than constant movement
